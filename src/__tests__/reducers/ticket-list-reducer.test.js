//JEST Refresher: 
// Describe blocks group related tests
// Test blocks are the individual tests, this test makes sure our reducer returns correct default value
// Expect statements are assertions of what code should return.

// Reducers are pure functions that won't hold any info about applications current state
// Initial test will check that our reducer returns default state when no action is passed into it (or null)
